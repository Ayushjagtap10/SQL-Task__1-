 Task Overview: Library Management System - Database Design

In this task, I designed a relational database schema for a Library Management System. The goal was to define entities, relationships, and create normalized tables using SQL.

What I Did:

1] Selected the Library domain.

2] Identified key entities: Books, Authors, Members, and Loans.

3] Defined relationships, including many-to-many (Books–Authors) and one-to-many (Members–Loans).

4] Wrote SQL scripts to:

   a] Create the database and tables.

   b] Define primary and foreign keys.

5] Answered key database interview questions related to normalization, keys, constraints, and relationships.

6] Included an ER diagram (to be added) to visualize the scheme
